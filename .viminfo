	In the project directory, you can run:
	
	### `npm start`
	
	Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
	Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
	
	The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
	You will also see any lint errors in the console.
	
	### `npm test`
	
	Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
	See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
	
	### `npm run build`
	
	Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
	It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
	
	The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
	Your app is ready to be deployed!
	
	See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
	
	### `npm run eject`
	
	**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
	
	If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
	
	327
<Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.
	
	282
<You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
